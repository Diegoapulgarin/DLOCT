# DEEP LEARNING METHOD FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES WITH LATERAL SUBSAMPLING

The project is made up of 5 files as follows:

## functions:

metrics.py

models.py

utils.py

## main code

DefineModel_train_test.py:

This defines the model and the parameters to be used. in these the synthetic tomograms are loaded.


Analyzing Experimental Tomograms.py:

in this the previously trained model and the experimental tomograms are loaded, in this script the qualitative and quantitative metrics are also evaluated.
